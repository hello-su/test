
The naming format for the result files is as follows: WM_Result_Table2_n, where n denotes the instance's scale.

The information for the result files consists of a total of 100 lines, containing the following information:

	index DV DN Time

where

	index: The index of the instance, corresponding to the 100 randomly generated instances.
  
	DV: The minimum total deviation effort as a percentage of the absolute norm of the original cost vector c.

	DN: The number of adjusted cost elements as a percentage of the total number of cost elements in c.

	Time: Computational time in seconds.
